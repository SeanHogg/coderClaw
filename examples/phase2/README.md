### Security & RBAC

```
=== coderClaw Phase 2 Security Example ===

1. Authenticating user...
   User authenticated: Developer (user-123)

2. Verifying device...
   Device: laptop-001

4. Getting effective permissions...
   Permissions:
     - task:submit
     - task:read
     - task:cancel
     - agent:invoke
     - skill:execute

5. Checking permissions...
   task:submit: ✓ Allowed
   config:write: ✗ Denied
   Reason: Missing required permission: config:write

6. Setting up repo policy...
   Repo policy set for: /projects/example

7. Checking agent access...
   code-modifier agent: ✗ Denied
   Reason: Agent code-modifier requires trusted device

8. Checking skill access...
   shell-exec skill: ✗ Denied
   Reason: Skill shell-exec is dangerous and requires trusted device

9. Recording audit log...
   Audit entry recorded

10. Querying audit log...
   Found 1 audit entries
   - 2024-01-15T10:35:00.000Z: task.submit (allowed)

Example complete!
```

### Task Lifecycle

```
=== coderClaw Phase 2 Task Lifecycle Example ===

1. Creating tasks...
   Task 1: abc-123 (pending)
   Task 2: def-456 (pending)
   Task 3: ghi-789 (pending)

2. Executing task 1...
   Status: planning
   Status: running
   Progress: 50%
   Progress: 100%
   Status: completed

3. Executing task 2...
   Progress: 30%
   Status: waiting (external input required)
   Status: running (resumed)
   Status: completed

4. Executing task 3 (with failure)...
   Progress: 20%

9. Testing invalid state transition...
   ✓ Invalid transition blocked: Invalid status transition from pending to completed for task jkl-012

```

## Understanding the Examples

### Transport Abstraction

The transport layer provides a protocol-agnostic interface. The examples use `LocalTransportAdapter`, but you can implement custom adapters for:

- HTTP/REST
- WebSocket
- gRPC
- Custom protocols

### Security Model

The security examples show the layered approach:

1. **Identity**: Who is making the request?
2. **Device Trust**: Is the device trusted?
3. **Roles & Permissions**: What can they do?
4. **Policies**: What are the constraints?
5. **Audit**: What happened?

### Task Lifecycle

Tasks follow a strict state machine:

- Only valid transitions are allowed
- All state changes are audited
- Progress can be tracked
- Tasks can be resumed after waiting
- Invalid transitions are rejected

## Next Steps

- Read the [Phase 2 documentation](../../docs/phase2.md)
- Review the [API reference](../../docs/api/)
- Try modifying the examples to suit your needs
- Implement custom transport adapters
- Create custom security policies

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors

Make sure you've built the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Type errors

The examples use TypeScript. If you get type errors, ensure your TypeScript version is compatible:

```bash
npm install -g typescript@latest
```

### Import errors

The examples use ES modules. Make sure your `package.json` has `"type": "module"`.
